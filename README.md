```bash
# Stream simulated EEG data with crossover alerts
python -m thetagate monitor --interval 1

# Run a sample hypnosis script
python -m thetagate run-script scripts/sample.txt --delay 3

# Run the script with speech synthesis (requires ELEVENLABS_API_KEY)
python -m thetagate run-script scripts/sample.txt --voice-id "YOUR_VOICE_ID"
